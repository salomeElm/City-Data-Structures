Java project implementing a country management system using linked lists, featuring city management and various calculations.

### Project Description
This project implements a country management system using linked lists in Java. 
The system is part of a university assignment and includes the following main components:

1. **Point Class:** Represents a coordinate in the Cartesian system.
